# Pacman-BerkeleyAI
This project contains my solution for the search scenarios introduced by the Berkeley Pacman project.
The whole project can be found here: http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html

## Requirements

This project requires a Python version no higher than 2.7 ! The project does not run on Python 3.10

##Usage

Here are the requirements that I implemented in my project: http://ai.berkeley.edu/search.html

I evaluated my solution with the help of the tests given my the project and they all successfully passed.  
Q1: Depth First Search  
Q2: Breadth First Search  
Q3: Uniform Cost Search  
Q4: A* Search  
Q5: Corners Problem: Representation  
Q6: Corners Problem: Heuristic  

## Usage

There are a few command lines presented in the following link: http://ai.berkeley.edu/search.html  
That help us run the rpoject and see the process of resolving the task.

The following photo illustrates the Pacman running after the A* algorithm

The next photo shows the algorithm A* weighted

All these photos and even more are to be found in the documentation (which is in Romanian).
My point was to prove the slightly better solution the A* weighetd has given to our problem

##Further development

Checking the other requrements and providing a solution for the remaining 2 questions of the search problem. Afterwards, there are a few other projects designed on this very Pacman.
